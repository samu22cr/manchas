# manchas - http server
manchas is an http server written in C. 

# features
- it serves static html docs

# current state ⚠️
Currently I am not developing this project, I will resume developing this project soon (believe me)

## project status and vision
This is not meant to be a production-ready server,
just a little fun project I created to explore network 
programming in a low-level fashion
